# Project 5 - Vampires Will Never Hurt You
## Description
If the sun comes up, will it tear the skin right off your bones? The clergymen of the St. Bellamuerte Cathedral certainly think so. Deep in the labyrinthine crypts, claw your way through those fallen from fortune and fame, and find your way home. 
## Implementation / Features you added
- Start game experience w/ entrance, end game/ exit & fade to black
- Two enemy behaviors - both move randomly, but one follows the player in a certain range (the black one)
- Atack & hit sound effects
- Student created Blood Flask model
- More "elaborate" menu w/ 3D scene built
- Creative use of materials & lighting w/ towering marble ceiling reflecting red light, rest is dark & illuminated by flashlight, reflecting off mirrored walls
